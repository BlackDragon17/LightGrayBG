# LightGrayBG
LightGrayBG is a simple tweak to the IntelliJ Light theme, changing its editor background color from pure white to a more pleasant light gray (hex: #FAFAFA).

Unfortunately, IntelliJ-based IDEs do not allow their users to make such simple changes without enabling JetBrain's internal development tools — which is the reason for this simple theme’s existence.
