# LightGrayBG
LightGrayBG is a simple tweak to the IntelliJ Light theme, changing its editor background color from pure white to a more pleasant light gray (hex: #FAFAFA).

Unfortunately, IntelliJ-based IDEs do not allow their users to make such simple changes without enabling JetBrain's internal development tools — which is the reason for this simple theme’s existence.

### Installation
LightGrayBG is compatible with all IntelliJ-based IDEs. Grab `LightGrayBG-1.x.zip` from the latest release, navigate to the IDE's setting's plugin page > Install Plugin from Disk, and choose the zip file.
