# LightGrayBG
LightGrayBG is a simple tweak to the IntelliJ Light theme, changing its editor background color from pure white to a more pleasant light gray (hex: #FAFAFA).

Unfortunately, IntelliJ-based IDEs do not allow their users to make such simple changes without enabling JetBrain's internal development tools â€” which is the reason for this simple theme's existence.

## IntelliJ New UI
With the new UI introduced as a Beta in 2022.3, UI elements such as the tree view now have a light gray background per default. Thus, there is no need for a full plugin anymore, since customizing the remaining editor and and terminal views can be achieved via a simple theme file.

## Installation

### 2022.3+ New UI Beta
Get the `LightGrayBG.icls` theme file from the [latest release](https://github.com/BlackDragon17/LightGrayBG/releases/latest) and import it under Settings > Editor > Color Scheme > gear icon > Import Scheme

### Old UI
Get the `LightGrayBG-1.x.zip` plugin file from the [v1.3 release](https://github.com/BlackDragon17/LightGrayBG/releases/tag/v1.3) and install it under Settings > Plugins > gear icon > Install Plugin from Disk
