# LightGrayBG
LightGrayBG is a simple tweak to the IntelliJ Light theme, changing its editor background color from pure white to a more pleasant light gray (hex: #FAFAFA).

Unfortunately, IntelliJ-based IDEs do not allow their users to make such simple changes without enabling internal development tools, which is the reason for this themeâ€™s existence.
